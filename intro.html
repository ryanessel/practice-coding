    <!-- the magic happens inside this tag - 
            it's HTML5 tag that supports animation -->
            <!-- CANVAS NEEDS AND ID MAKES IT EASIER TO SEE IN A SCRIPT!!! -->
    <canvas id="example" width="300" height="300"></canvas>   <!-- you set the width and height like so -->
 
<!-- 4 different types of contexts for <canvas> tags
    
1. 2D leadign to the createion of a CanvasRenderingContext2D object representing a two dimension redning context
2. webgl ()a WebGLRenderingContext object representing a three-dimensional rendering context. This context is only available on browsers that implement WebGL version 1
3. webgl2 which will create a WebGL2RenderingContext object representing a three-dimensional rendering context. This context is only available on browsers that implement WebGL version 2 (OpenGL ES 3.0).
4. bitmaprenderer- which will create an imageBitMmapRenderingContext whioch only provides functionality to replace the content of the canvas given a bitmap image.

<!-- canvas is blank at first. Need a script to access the rendering context and draw on it.
canvas has a JS method called "getContext()". it takes one param, and we only need to know "2d" for now.
This is used to rendering context and its drawing fuctions

    <!-- include js file after DOM is loaded; 
            if included earlier, you have to use window.onload = function(){ ... } 
            approach in your intro.js file -->
